This repository contains all of the (somewhat cleaned) scripts from my Master's thesis at the Center for Limnology. It contains jupyter notebook files (in the python folder) that conduct spectral mixture 
analysis (SMA) on the lake ice of Taylor Valley lakes, in order to quantify sediment coverage through time using Landsagt 8 imagery. It also contains numerous data scripts breaking down the SMA outputs to compare against lake ice thicknesses. There is also an ice thickness model (uses the 1-D heat equation) for East Lobe Bonney. There's quite a bit in here, so if you have any questions please contact me!

Lake ice thickness and meteorological data comes from the McMurdo Long Term Ecological Research Project (MCM LTER, https://mcm.lternet.edu/). Please cite the LTER for any data usage (long term data is important!). 

Landsat 8 data was accessed through Google Earth Engine, and was provided courtesy of the United States Geological Survey.
